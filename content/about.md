Hey.  
I am Francesco known as **Airscript** on the web.

Since childhood I have shown a strong curiosity for what was around me: video games, sports or cinematography.  
Just to name a few of the thousands of things that fascinate me.

Oh yes, I cannot fail to make an honorable mention of paleontology and dinosaurs in particular.
Between you and me, I hadn't really forgotten about them; I wanted them to get the attention they deserve.

Of all of them, though, computer science was the one that I never lost sight of.
The possibility of being able to create tools that could improve people's lives through lines of code excited me so much that I made this interest, **passion** and later also **job**.
