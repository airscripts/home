## Hello World!  
I’m Francesco, known online as **Airscript**.  

Since I was a kid, I’ve always been curious about the world around me—videogames, sports, cinematography—just to name a few of the countless things that fascinate me.  

Oh, and let’s not forget paleontology—especially **dinosaurs**.  
*Between us, I didn’t really forget them. I just wanted to make sure they got the spotlight they deserve.*  

But out of everything, computer science is what stuck with me the most.  
The idea that I could build tools to improve people's lives through code got me hooked early on. What started as a spark turned into a full-blown **passion**, and eventually, my **career**.  

Today, I work as a **freelance software engineer**, helping bring ideas to life through technology.  

*To make something special, you just have to believe that it is special.*  
*Mr. Ping, Kung Fu Panda*
